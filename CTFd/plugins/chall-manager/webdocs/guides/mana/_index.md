## Goal 
Here, we assume that you are a CTF administrator, the infrastructure is already configured and you understand the key concepts.

During your event you may need to monitor the consumed mana for Source.

## How to do it 
Access the plugin settings configuration in the `CTFd Admin Panel` > `Plugins` > `chall-manager` > `Mana`
